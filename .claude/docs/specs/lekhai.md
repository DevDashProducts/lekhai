A simple speech to text transcription app built by DevDash Labs as a PoC

## Features 

while we have created a docker to help with sql-based storage, we should also have a local sql storage on the folder so that the user can save locally (for the time being). to do this, review the code base, make sure you clearly understand how you do it. make a plan to create the sql database locally, you can also use sql-lite if that's eaiser 

there is a database/init as well, is the database/sqlite/init a different? help me understand where the data will be saved? like where is the actual database being stored? teach me please. 
  also, there are several app/db-test, app/db-test-sqlite, app/test-db-models - WHY? why do we have so many duplicates?
